# Crowdfunding smart contract

## Planning and design

- The admin will start a campaign for crowdfunding with a specific monetary goal and deadline
- Contributors will contribute to that project by sending ETH
- The admin has to create a spending request to spend money for the campaign
- Once the spending request was created, the contributors can start voting for that specific spending request
- If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request, then the admin would have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request
- The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the deadline

The power is moved from the campaign's admin to those that donated money.
